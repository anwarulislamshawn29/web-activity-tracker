      <button class="faq-question">What does Web Activity Tracker do?</button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Web Activity Tracker monitors the time you spend on websites, helping you understand your browsing habits. It tracks time per domain, provides daily/weekly/monthly summaries, and lets you export your data as a CSV file.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">How do I use the extension?</button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Click the extension icon to open the popup. You'll see a list of domains you've visited, along with the time spent. Use the tabs (Today, Yesterday, This Week, This Month, All Time) to filter your data. You can also export your data by clicking "Export Data" at the bottom.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">Does this extension work on all websites?</button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>The extension tracks time on websites using http or https protocols. It does not track time on Chrome internal pages (e.g., chrome://settings) or other protocols like file://.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">How is my data stored?</button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. No data is sent to external servers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">Can I delete my tracked data?</button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes, you can clear your tracked data by going to Chrome's extension settings. Navigate to chrome://extensions/, find Web Activity Tracker, and click "Remove" to delete all stored data. Alternatively, you can clear Chrome's local storage manually via Developer Tools.</p>

      <button class="faq-question">How accurate is the time tracking?</button>
      <div class="faq-answer">

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">How can I support the developer?</button>
